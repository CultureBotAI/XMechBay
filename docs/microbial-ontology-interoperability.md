# OBA and uPheno for microbial traits: fit with METPO and TraitMech

Assessment date: 2026-11-07. This is a research and modeling assessment, not
an implemented ontology mapping or schema migration.

## Papers and scope

The two works considered are their published versions:

- Stefancsik et al. (2023), [The Ontology of Biological Attributes
  (OBA)—computational traits for the life sciences](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00335-023-09992-1).
  [Open full text](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10382347/).
- Matentzoglu et al. (2025), [The Unified Phenotype Ontology: a framework for
  cross-species integrative phenomics](https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyaf027).
  [Open full text](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11912833/).

OBA provides neutral biological attributes through Entity–Quality definitions,
design patterns, and logical classification. It distinguishes attributes from
phenotype states and measurement methods. Its formal design is species-independent,
but the paper describes its coverage focus as Metazoan traits. The framework is
applicable beyond that focus; the paper does not establish comprehensive microbial
coverage.

uPheno provides shared phenotype patterns, species-neutral grouping classes, and
cross-ontology mappings. Its reported integrations include fission yeast,
ascomycetes, Dictyostelium, and pathogen–host phenotypes, with varying integration
depth. Thus microbial eukaryotes already participate. This does not demonstrate
comprehensive bacterial or archaeal ecophysiological coverage. The paper explicitly
leaves actual comparators and effect sizes to annotation metadata.

These statements describe the publications, not an exhaustive audit of subsequent
OBA or uPheno releases. The recommendations below are proposed applications to
microbial data, not experimental results reported by either paper.

## Complementary roles

| Resource or layer | Role | Microbial example |
|---|---|---|
| OBA | Neutral attribute: what varies | Cell length or a precisely defined growth rate |
| uPheno | Comparable phenotype state | Increased cell length relative to a reference |
| METPO | Microbial ecophysiological concepts and relations | Halophily, oxygen requirements, substrate use, growth optima |
| Observation/profile data | Organism-specific evidence and context | Strain, medium, assay, conditions, value, unit, comparator |
| TraitMech | Definitions, provenance, organism examples, and mechanism evidence | Supported processes and proteins associated with a trait |

The architecture should connect these layers without conflating them. A neutral
attribute is not equivalent to its increased or decreased state. An assay measures
an attribute but is not the attribute. A semantic mapping does not establish a
causal mechanism.

## Concrete microbial modeling choices

| Concept | Recommended treatment | Boundary to preserve |
|---|---|---|
| Cell length and width | First candidates for OBA alignment | Review bearer, quality, and logical axioms before asserting equivalence |
| Increased cell length after perturbation | Relative phenotype linked to the neutral attribute and an explicit control | Do not equate it with neutral cell length |
| Growth rate | Specify elongation, biomass increase, cell-count increase, or colony expansion | Different readouts are not interchangeable |
| Growth temperature optimum | Preserve the growth-response and ambient-temperature interpretation | It is not automatically cell/body temperature |
| Halophily or anaerobiosis | Preserve METPO's microbial definitions | Normal adaptations are not inherently abnormal phenotypes |
| Substrate use | Preserve the organism-level relation and chemical object | Chemical-use capability is not a chemical-amount measurement |

The existing [cell length record](https://github.com/CultureBotAI/TraitMech/blob/0c20b4c82a8b5ae4a883cbc536abfd6fdca6380a/data/traits/morphology/cell_length.yaml)
uses `METPO:1000881`; cell width uses `METPO:1000882`. The
[temperature optimum record](https://github.com/CultureBotAI/TraitMech/blob/0c20b4c82a8b5ae4a883cbc536abfd6fdca6380a/data/traits/environment/temperature_optimum.yaml)
uses `METPO:1000304`. No OBA or uPheno exact-match identifier is asserted here.
Label similarity alone is insufficient, especially where one source models a
quality and another models a phenotype containing that quality.

Keep single-cell, culture/population, and community scales distinct. A function
observed in a community need not be a capability of every member organism. Likewise,
isolation from an acidic environment does not by itself establish acidophily, and
failure to grow in one assay does not establish universal inability to grow.
The [METPO source snapshot](https://github.com/CultureBotAI/TraitMech/blob/0c20b4c82a8b5ae4a883cbc536abfd6fdca6380a/data/raw/metpo.owl)
already makes the environment/phenotype and conditional growth distinctions.

## Fit with the existing implementation

This assessment inspected TraitMech commit
`0c20b4c82a8b5ae4a883cbc536abfd6fdca6380a` and its METPO `2026-06-12` snapshot.
It does not assert that these are the latest upstream versions.

The [TraitMech schema](https://github.com/CultureBotAI/TraitMech/blob/0c20b4c82a8b5ae4a883cbc536abfd6fdca6380a/src/traitmech/schema/traitmech.yaml)
already separates several relevant concerns:

- Trait records preserve METPO identifiers, definitions, synonym scope, and parents.
- Cross-references are intended for true equivalents; broader/narrower or
  attribute-to-state relations need appropriately typed mappings.
- Causal edges require supporting evidence.
- Protein examples pair organism-specific protein instances with source taxa,
  separately from generic mechanism concepts.
- Graph scope distinguishes mechanisms from measurement/classification context.

Both the cell-length and temperature-optimum records explicitly label their graphs
`NONMECHANISTIC`. Ontology integration should respect these reviewed dispositions.
Phenotype similarity can prioritize candidate mechanisms for investigation, but
cannot by itself establish conserved machinery, homology, or causality.

The main practical extension is structured observation context. The inspected
exemplar model can retain measured values and conditions in notes. A linked
observation model would make strain, versioned genome, genotype/perturbation,
medium, assay, growth phase, conditions, value/unit, uncertainty, comparator, and
measured-versus-predicted status directly queryable. This is a bounded observation
about TraitMech's exemplar model, not a claim that such models are absent elsewhere.

and [grounding policy](https://github.com/CultureBotAI/TraitMech/blob/0c20b4c82a8b5ae4a883cbc536abfd6fdca6380a/docs/GROUNDING_POLICY.md).

## Recommended pilot and acceptance criteria

Start with one cell-dimension attribute before expanding to growth traits:

1. Review the METPO class and a candidate OBA class at the axiom level, including
   bearer, quality, and class-versus-property distinctions.
2. Record the appropriate mapping relation, evidence, source versions, and curator
   rationale in SSSOM. Use exact equivalence only when justified.
3. Link one measured observation and one comparator-dependent phenotype, retaining
   strain, medium, growth phase, value/unit, and control metadata.
4. Run logical classification checks. Verify the intended parent relationships and
   that neutral cell length does not become equivalent to increased cell length.
5. Confirm that mapping creates no unsupported causal edge in TraitMech, then assess
   expansion to additional dimensions and ecophysiological traits.

Success means that measurements and comparative phenotypes can be found through
shared attribute concepts while their experimental and biological scope remains
recoverable. This proposal changes no scientific data or ontology axioms.
